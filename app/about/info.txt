Notes about Next js with the About as an example.


About is a directory.
All routes created here will extend /About
layout.tsx is only for about pages. the styling here and any components added will apply only to about pages

styles.module.css are specific to the  about page.
global styles are for the whole  app


metadata is added to the top of the pages

Loading page is created for loading state

error handeling page added, different from a 404 page

**if we need to route to /owners where the endpoints are "/about/owners/" we create a folder as the route base name and we create pages.tsx file for the route name /owners we can set up and style this page 

if we decide to create a route to "/about/owners/portfolio/"  we need to create a folder called portfolio and we continue as explained in /owners **(see above)
